Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JS / Restaurant website

Pizza Bubonja's is not real restaurant. This website is part of my portfolio and is completely fictional.

Run following commands in your terminal to run this flask application:

git clone https://github.com/sinisabubonja/pizzabubonjas.git
python3.6 -m venv pizzabubonjas
cd pizzabubonjas
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser and that's it!
